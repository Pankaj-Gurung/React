Key Concepts

Why CNNs Are Effective for Images
Traditional neural networks are not efficient for image data due to high dimensionality.
CNNs process image data more efficiently by:
Detecting patterns like edges, textures, and shapes.
Reducing the number of parameters with shared weights and local connectivity.
Components of a CNN
Convolutional Layers:

Apply filters (kernels) to the image to detect features.
Each filter highlights specific patterns (e.g., horizontal edges, vertical edges).
Output: Feature maps.
Activation Function (ReLU):

Introduces non-linearity to the network.
Ensures the CNN can learn complex patterns.
Pooling Layers:

Reduce the size of feature maps (spatial dimensions).
Example: MaxPooling selects the maximum value in a region, retaining important features.
Fully Connected Layers:

Flatten the feature maps into a 1D array.
Perform classification using these features.
Image Classification Pipeline

Input Image:
An image is represented as a grid of pixels (e.g., 28x28 for grayscale).
Pixel intensity values range from 0 to 255.
Feature Extraction (Convolution + Pooling):

Convolutional layers extract features from the image.
Pooling layers reduce dimensionality and retain important information.

Classification:
Fully connected layers use the extracted features to predict the class label.
How CNNs Learn
Lower layers detect simple patterns like edges.
Deeper layers combine these patterns to recognize more complex structures like shapes or objects.
The final layer outputs probabilities for each class.

Applications of CNNs
Object Detection: Recognizing objects in an image.
Medical Imaging: Classifying diseases in X-rays or MRIs.
Face Recognition: Identifying individuals.
Takeaway: CNNs are highly effective for image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically detect hierarchical patterns, making them a cornerstone of modern computer vision.
